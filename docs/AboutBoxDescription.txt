DESCRIPTION:
- ETABS Plugin Application automatic the iterative calibration of pile stiffnesses in 
  conjunction with Oasys PDisp.
- The Tool iterates the analysis in the selected ETABS and PDisp models transferring 
  data between the two until convergence is reached based on user's input criteria.
  
ALGORITHM:
- Base point reactions at piles locations are extracted from the ETABS model 
  and transferred to the PDisp Model converting them in corresponding soil pressures
- PDisp Model analysis is run and updated vertical displacements at pile locations
  are extracted and used to compute the corresponding pile stiffnesses
- Updated pile stiffnesses are assigned to the base points in the ETABS model and 
  the analysis is re-run.
- PDisp and ETABS Models are saved with label named after iteration step number
- Process continues until convergence is achieved.

UI FEATURES:
- Windows Form allowing the user to select the following items:
	- ETABS Group collecting points corresponding to pile locations
	- ETABS Load Combination used for loads computation
	- Initial Pile Stiffness Values set to be used
	- PDisp Model File Location
	- Maximum Displacement Variation between iteration steps for convergence
	- Maximum Number of Analysis Iterations
  
LIMITATIONS:
- Pile Point Objects must have the same labels/unique names assigned in both the ETABS
  and in the PDisp Model.
- Pile Point Objects in the ETABS Model to be all assigned with the same Group 
	- Group MUST BE DIFFERENT than the default "All" Group
